            <p> This work is the first completed exclusively by me and is part of our education at MIT University. It is essentially a demonstration of what we have learned with our own art touches. Until the end of my training I will continue to enrich the content as well as to improve the existing one. Feel free to contact me through my contact links for suggestions, corrections, explanations or anything you would like to know about me and my work.</p>

            <p><br>My name is Panagiotis Votsis and I am from Greece. I was born on October 10th, 1987 and my hometown, Astakos, is found in western Greece. I finished there High School and then studied in the department of Physics at the University of Patras. After that I dealt with various jobs but due to the economic crisis that hit Greece that time I decided to move abroad and I came to Munich. I currently live and work here as a professional bus driver during the day and I do my training as a programmer at nights. I speak Greek, English and German. </p>
